# ðŸ“Š The Property Pricer

This is a quick demonstration of a property pricing app. Enter the postcode, property type,
and pricing type, as well as how confident you want us to be in our estimate, and we'll tell you the
price range you're looking at.

We support the following property types:
* Detached
* Semi-Detached
* Terrace
* Flat
* Other

We also offer two pricing options, to make the numbers as transparent as we can:
* **Adjusted** price - Don't care if your nan bought her house for Â£3000? This options for you. We adjust the house prices for what you'll pay today, so you see how much houses would have cost, if all of them were sold this month.
* **Unadjusted** price - Just tell me what it sold for, when it sold, nobody likes a clever clogs.
